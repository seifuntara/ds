*Hi! My name is Muhammad Seif and I'm a computer science fresh graduate whose main interest is in data science and analytics. Here are some projects I have worked on:*

### [Badminton Match Outcome Prediction](FP.ipynb) 🏆
Predicting the winner of a badminton match by making use of logistic regression and its interaction terms using evolutionary computation to outperform less interpretable models like boosted trees. Data collected by web scraping from [badmintonstatistics.net](https://badmintonstatistics.net/) and [bwf.tournamentsoftware.com](https://bwf.tournamentsoftware.com/)

### [Cardiac MR Image Segmentation](NC_Project.ipynb) ❤️
Image segmentation of a cardiovascular MR to identify heart ventricles and myocardium by optimizing different convolutional neural networks architectures (U-net, FCN, DeepLab) with various optimizers and loss functions using PyTorch.

### [Dataquest Projects](https://github.com/seifuntara/ds/tree/master/dataquest)
A collection of small Python projects I have worked on throughout my self taught journey and early stages of learning data science with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Projects include topics covering on data analysis, data visualization and machine learning.
